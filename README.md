*__NCR Ride-Hailing Service Analysis__*

__*Project Overview*__

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of ride-hailing service data from the National Capital Region (NCR). The goal is to uncover trends, identify key performance indicators, and derive actionable insights from a dataset of over 148,000 ride bookings. The analysis focuses on booking patterns, revenue, cancellation reasons, and popular locations to better understand the service's operations.
Dataset The primary dataset for this analysis is ncr_ride_bookings.csv. It contains detailed information for each ride, including:
 * Booking and Customer IDs
 * Ride status (Completed, Cancelled, Incomplete)
 * Vehicle type
 * Pickup and drop-off locations
 * Ride value and distance
 * Customer and driver ratings
 * Reasons for cancellation

*__Git LFS (Large File Storage) Setup__*
Important: This repository uses Git LFS to manage large data files (.csv). To ensure you download the actual data files instead of pointers, you need to have Git LFS installed.
 * *__Install Git LFS:__* If you don't have it, download and install it from the official website.
 * *__Set up LFS:__* Run git lfs install once per user account to set up Git LFS.
 * *__Clone the repository:__* Clone the repository as you normally would:
   git clone [repository-url]

   Git LFS will automatically detect and download the large files during the cloning process. If you have already cloned the repository without LFS, run git lfs pull to download the data files.
